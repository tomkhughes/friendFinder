# friendFinder
## Overview
In this project, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from  users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. App uses express.js to handle routes.
